# GreenClock
Simple (Low cost) Internet Clock

Okay, so what is so different from the other internet clock I have in https://github.com/seryafarma/WifiDeskClock ?

This project was built-up using some leftover materials I found in my shed when I was cleaning up.

- Wemos D1 Mini
- 3 * MAX7219 DIY Modules (that I have soldered maybe almost 10 years ago)
- Unused Prototyping Board
- and in general other small items.

So it is quite similar to the _WifiDeskClock_ project, however this is way simpler, less fancy, 1 digits less, and more compact. Nevertheless, it is a handy small DIY looking clock for my work desk.
